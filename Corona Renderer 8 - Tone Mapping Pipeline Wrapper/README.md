Hello all,
this is a wrapper <code>(Tone Mapping Pipeline Wrapper.ms)</code> for new Corona renderer 8 tone mapping which is kind of pain to work with. so here is my maxscript codes to make it easier for users to use this new feature.
<br><br>
In my humble opinion, Corona new tone mapper could output easily as nice array of operators and it make things a whole lot easier and way more flexible for coders to use this awesome feature but the Corona team decides to make it hard for others to work with it.
<br><br>
there is also an official wiki for this from Corona renderer team that you can find it here:
<br> https://wiki.corona-renderer.com/maxscript
<br><br>
you can use this wrapper pretty easily it is kind of make array of operators and work around that to make things nice and clean.
